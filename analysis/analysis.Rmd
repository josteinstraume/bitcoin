# <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction
> Cryptocurrency is a digit currency and acts as a medium for exchanges/transactions. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which means it is not processed by any banking system and goes straight to the consumers. The transactions are posted on an online ledger for transparency. Usersâ€™ identities are protected through an encryption key, which is a feature that Bitcoin has.
> Bitcoin is one of the popular choices of cryptocurrency. Since its introduction into the market in 2009, it has drastically increased and decreased in value. The analysis below will offer insights on the characteristics of the cryptocurrency and its projected value and trend.

# <a name="problem-statement"></a>Problem Statement
> Develop a time series model based on an observed set of explanatory variables that can be utilized to predict future price of Bitcoin.

# <a name="constraints"></a>Constraints and Limitations
> Bitcoin was created in 2009, and the available data in the dataset begins in April 2013. We are constrained by not seeing all of the history of this currency within the dataset.
> The data is sourced from Kaggle, which is ultimately sourced from another site that tracks Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are limitations on the amount of metadata available from this source, particularly around how the market-level breakdown is sourced into one cohesive price in the Historical data.
> There are some potentially confounding variables inherent in an analysis of Bitcoin. The market valuation is consistently changing on a daily basis with the mining of coins, and the nature of the market is highly dependent on supply and demand. There is also one owner who has 5% of the market share, whose actions may contribute to the behavior of the market prices.
> There is some data missing, particularly in the Volume variable. The subsequent analysis does not rely on Volume due to lack of colinearity with this variable, but this may have been due to missing data.

# <a name="description"></a>Data Set Description
> The dataset for this analysis was pulled from [Kaggle: Cryptocurrency Historical Prices ](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory).
> The data is taken from the historical data available on [coinmarketcap.](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/)


| Variable | Variable Type | Summary |
| :------: | :-----------: | :-----: |
| Date | DateTime | Date for summary info|
| Open | Numeric | Opening market price for Bitcoin |
| High | Numeric | Daily high price for Bitcoin |
| Low | Numeric | Daily low price for Bitcoin |
| Close | Numeric | Closing market price for Bitcoin |
| Volume | Numeric | Total amount of Bitcoin available|
| Market Cap | Numeric | Market Capitalization ([valuation](https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-market-cap-not-think/) of the overall currency market)|
| Time | DateTime| Conversion of original Date variable for analysis use|

> It is unclear from the sources exactly how the terms Open and Close are defined in the data source. In general, [Bitcoin is always open](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/41055/bitcoin-market-hours-open-close-prices), as a market. The timestamp to mark Opening price and Closing price are based on the timezone of a market, and it turns over at midnight each day. With global markets and multiple timezones, there is no standard time across all markets. Without a clear description available from the source, it is not possible to clearly articulate the exact variable meaning in the real world.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Load lubridate package to convert dates from factor to date class
library(lubridate)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(DescTools)

# File path of the data set
path <- "/Users/Jostein/Grad School/SMU/6372/project2/bitcoin/data/bitcoin_price.csv"

# Read in the CSV file of the data set
bitcoin <- read.csv(path, header = TRUE)

# Create new variable time via Lubridate, then order data set by ascending time
bitcoin$Time <- mdy(bitcoin$Date)
bitcoin <- bitcoin[order(bitcoin$Time),]
```

> Snapshot of the data set

```{r echo = FALSE}
str(bitcoin)
dim(bitcoin)
head(bitcoin)
```

> The above output shows the structure, dimension, and head of the data set. There are 1,630 observations with 8 explanatory variables.

> Summary statistics of daily closing price of bitcoin:

```{r echo = FALSE}
summary(bitcoin$Close)
```

> Summary statistics of daily high price of bitcoin:

```{r echo = FALSE}
summary(bitcoin$High)
```

> Additional summary statistics and subsequent analysis indicated that most other variables are similar in trend to the closing price, which was selected as the response variable for the analysis.

# <a name="eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r echo = FALSE}
# Line plot of daily closing price of bitcoin
# Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9053437/r-plot-with-an-x-time-axis-how-to-force-the-ticks-labels-to-be-the-days
plot(bitcoin$Close, type = "l", ylab = "Close Prices (USD)", main = "Daily Closing Price of Bitcoin", xaxt = "n")
#axis.POSIXct(1, bitcoin$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
#axis.Date(1, bitcoin$Time)
```

> The above plot reflects the daily closing price of bitcoin from to April 28th, 2013 to October 3rd, 2017. Although there appears to be no pattern in the change of the closing price, a general increase in price over time is apparent. Increasing variance over time necessitates transformation of the original data.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Transformation appears to be needed
bitcoin$Log_Close <- log(bitcoin$Close)
bitcoin$Sqrt_Close <- sqrt(bitcoin$Close)

# How do we get to stationary?
# First differences for original and transformed data sets
diff1 <- diff(bitcoin$Close, lag = 1)
logDiff1 <- diff(bitcoin$Log_Close, lag = 1)
sqrtDiff1 <- diff(bitcoin$Sqrt_Close, lag = 1)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
fitClose <- lm(Close ~ Time, data = bitcoin)
fitLogClose <- lm(Log_Close ~ Time, data = bitcoin)
fitSqrtClose <- lm(Sqrt_Close ~ Time, data = bitcoin)
par(mfrow = c(3, 3))
hist(bitcoin$Close, main = "Daily Closing Price")
plot(fitClose, which = 1:2)
hist(bitcoin$Log_Close, main = "Daily Logged Closing Price")
plot(fitLogClose, which = 1:2)
hist(bitcoin$Sqrt_Close, main = "Daily Square-Root Closing Price")
plot(fitSqrtClose, which = 1:2)
```

> The above diagnostic plots confirm the need for transformation, as well as give insight into which transformation is most appropriate. The histograms of both the original data and logged data are heavily right skewed, with the former to a larger degree. Additionally, the Q-Q plots for the original data and logged data venture far of the path of diagonal line. In contrast, the logged data displays a normal distribution for its histogram, as well as a fairly good Q-Q plot. The tail ends of the logged Q-Q plot indicate some skewness at both ends, which the corresponding histogram supports. However, the size of our data set should ease any concern we might have. The residual diagnostic plot of the logged data reflects non-constant variance. This will be addressed by taking the first degree difference of the logged daily closing price.

```{r echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(diff1, type = "l", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Difference", main = "First Difference for Original Data")
plot(logDiff1, type = "l", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Difference", main = "First Difference for Logged Data")
```

> The variance of the first difference between the original and logged data are vastly different. In the original data the increasing variance as time goes one is visually clear, whereas the variance of the logged data is reasonably constant with no apparent patterns.

```

> The above heat map correlation matrix offers limited new comprehension of the bitcoin data set, but is still helpful nonetheless. Volume of daily bitcoin trades has a weak positive correlation (R = 0.20) with logged closing price, and a moderate positive correlation (R = 0.38) with time. This suggests that as time goes on, the volume of trades increases and might have a impact on the closing price of bitcoin. Of note, the total market cap of mined bitcoins has a moderate positive correlation with logged closing prices. In other words, the total value of mined bitcoins possibly influences the closing price.

> The original and logged closing prices have strong positive correlations with time (R = 0.61, and R = 0.71 respectively). This suggests the need to address auto correlation issues. Moreover, the following variables are 100% colinear with each other: High, Low, Open, and Close. This makes sense as all of the said variables pertain to the price of bitcoin. To reduce redundancy, only the closing price of bitcoin will be utilized for a time series model. 

# <a name="model-selection"></a>Model Selection
> Analysis of the daily closing price of bitcoin can now be carried out. Instead of manually testing various models, the computer will select the best from a plethora of models based on their respective Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value. Invoking the trace option in the auto.arima() function allows the user to see which exact models the computer is testing, as seen below:

```{r echo = FALSE}
myts <-ts(data = bitcoin$Log_Close, start = c(2013, 118), frequency = 365)
arima_fit <- auto.arima(myts, ic = "aic", trace = TRUE)
summary(arima_fit)
```

> It appears that an ARIMA model with an order of (0, 1, 0) with a constant has been selected, which corresponds to a random walk model with drift. In other words, the best forecast for tomorrow's closing price of bitcoin is based on today's closing price plus a drift term. The general historical trend of bitcoin's closing price determine's the drift term.

```{r echo = FALSE}
forecast_arima_fit <- forecast(arima_fit, h = 75)
plot(forecast_arima_fit, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Logged Closing Price")
```

> The above plot reflects the forecast of bitcoin's logged closing price for the next 75 days ahead of October 3rd, 2017. The predicted forecast values are represented as the blue line, and the drift terms appear as the grey fan shape around the forecasted values. The accuracy of the forecast model is best seen by testing it against already known observations. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
accuracy(f = forecast_arima_fit, x = myts[1546:1620])
```

> Fortunately, the accuracy() function in the forecast library of R provides a convenient vehicle in which to discern the precision of the forecast model. The above table output shows, among many things, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for both the training and test set. In this scenario, the last 75 days of the data set were used as the test set. The training set had a RMSE value of 0.04296455, whereas the test set had a RMSE value of 0.27269486. So, the difference in the standard deviation of the residuals between the training and test set was 0.2297303.The fact that the test RMSE value is over 6 times greater than the training set may indicate the presene of overfitting. If so however, it may very well be the case that the best model is simply over-fit.

# <a name="serial-correlation"></a>Serial Correlation

par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
acf(residuals(forecast_arima_fit), main = "Autocorrelation Function of ARIMA model")
pacf(residuals(forecast_arima_fit), main = "Partial Autocorrelation Function of ARIMA model")
Box.test(residuals(forecast_arima_fit))
```
